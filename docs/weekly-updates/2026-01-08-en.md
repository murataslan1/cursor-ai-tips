## 🆕 Cursor 2.3 New Features

### Process Separation
Extensions now run in separate processes from built-in Cursor extensions. A crashing extension doesn't bring down core functionality.

4 default layouts:
- **Agent Mode:** AI-agent focused work
- **Editor Mode:** Classic code editor view
- **Zen Mode:** Mode that minimizes distractions
- **Browser Mode:** Working with integrated browser

**Shortcuts:**
- `⌘ + ⌥ + ⇥` - Switch between layouts
